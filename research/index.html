		How does k-12 school economic segregation impact lower-income studentsâ€™ college enrollment and employment prospects? using data from Texas, I find that the typical lower-income student goes through grades 5 to 12 having one-fifth the share of upper-income classmates of their upper-income counterparts, and one in every five lower-income students has a smaller than 1% share of upper-income classmates. I use within-school residual variation from school trends in the proportion of upper-income students to capture the impact of having a higher share of upper-income peers. I distinguish between two possible explanations for the relationship between exposure to upper-income classmates and long-term outcomes: spillover from peers with higher family income and spillover from higher-achieving peers. The slope of the relationship between the proportion of upper-income peers and college enrollment and wages implies that, in the absence of income segregation, lower-income students' 4-year college enrollment would increase by 0.44 percentage points and their young adult quarterly wages would increase by 1.9%, on average. The impact of having upper-income peers is not sensitive to controlling for the share of higher-achieving peers.

	Recent work has highlighted a potential link between cross-income friendships and economic mobility. Schools are an important space for cross-income interactions. Although prior work has examined the impact of school choice policies on segregation, we know much less about the impact of school factors such as school course offering on cross-income exposure. The question of how advanced courses impact equity is particularly salient in policy discussions. I use rich school administrative data from Texas State linked to college enrollment and employment to capture the impact of the addition of Advanced Placement (AP) courses on lower-income students' exposure to upper-income students, and its impact on college enrollment and employment. To capture the impact of AP courses, I exploit variation in when an AP course is first added to a school subject area. I find evidence that adding an AP course in a subject area increases the exposure of lower-income students to upper-income classmates by 1.5 percentage points. This effect is driven by three subject areas: science, foreign language, and fine arts. The addition of an AP course increases the proportion of upper-income students taking courses within the subject area. The increase in the proportion of upper-income students in the subject area counters any increase in sorting by income after the addition of an AP course.	</details>

    <p class="paper_title">The Expansion of Alternative Schools: Impact of Schools Targeting Lower Performing Students</a></p>

        <summary>Abstract</summary>
	Although US public schools have made substantive progress in reducing the number of students who dropout of high school, there remains a substantial portion of students nationwide every year who do not obtain a high school degree. One strategy to address persistent high school dropout is to provide students with choice and flexibility in their schooling schedules and environments, often done through alternative schools. The expansion of alternative schools presents an interesting case of increased school heterogeneity, increasing the number of schools targeting lower performing students. In this paper, we use the variation in exposure to alternative schools to identify the impact of exposure to alternative schools on persistence, graduation, college enrollment, and arrests.
