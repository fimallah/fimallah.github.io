		<p style="font-size: 24pt"> I am a PhD Candidate in the Education Policy at Harvard. My research focuses on understanding how the ways schools and classrooms are organized could enable/hinder students' economic mobility. I use descriptive, quasi-experimental and experimental methods to uncover, understand and address the sources of persistent race-, immigrant- and class-based inequality. My recent research projects have been supported by the Russell Sage Foundation, Stone Program in Wealth Distribution, Inequality, and Social Policy and Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences. </p>
	
		<p style="font-size: 24pt">Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a Research Analyst in the Education and Crime Labs at UChicago and was a middle school mathematics teacher. I hold a B.Sc. in Economics from Georgetown University and an Ed.M. in International Education Policy from Harvard. </p>
