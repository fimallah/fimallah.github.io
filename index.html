		<p style="font-size: 11pt; text-align: left"> I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University. My research is in Applied Microeconomics, specializing in Labor Economics and the Economics of Education. My recent work focuses on how the organization of schools and classrooms affects economic mobility. I use descriptive, quasi-experimental and experimental methods to uncover, understand and address the sources of persistent race-, immigrant- and class-based inequality. My recent research projects have been supported by the <a href="https://www.russellsage.org/about">Russell Sage Foundation</a>, <a href="https://inequality.hks.harvard.edu/about">Stone Program in Wealth Distribution, Inequality, and Social Policy at Harvard</a> and <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/about">Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences</a>, and featured in the Harvard Ed. Magazine Fall 2024 issue <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/ed-magazine/24/11/economic-connectedness-and-classroom-interactions">here</a>.</p>
